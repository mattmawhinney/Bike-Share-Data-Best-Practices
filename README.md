CitiBike NYC / Bike Share Data Best Practices
=====================


This repository is designed to research CitiBike NYC / Bike Share data best practices and compile it into a clear ask for more data. This work is being documented in this repo's wiki.

In the [wiki](https://github.com/BetaNYC/Bike-Share-Data-Best-Practices/wiki), you will find links to other bike share open data systems, outlines of the data they provide, tools and apps, and examples of "open data" bike share laws.

In addtion to this repo, BetaNYC and NYU Rudin Center for Transportation hosts a [monthly BikeHack night](http://meetup.com/betanyc) and there is a [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/citibike-hackers). 

All of this grows from the launch of CitiBike NYC and Council Member Brad Lander introducing Int. No 1117-2013 on 24 July. This is local law would amend the administrative code of the City of New York forcing CitiBike NYC to frequently public trip data. You can [track this law on the New York City Council Legistar system](http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1458686&GUID=A0A12057-4AE3-4CC8-BCD3-3277B0F7E1E0&Options=ID%7cText%7c&Search).
